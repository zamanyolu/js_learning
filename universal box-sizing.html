<h1>The Universal box-sizing</h1>

<p>Since the result of using "box-sizing: border-box" is so much better, many developers want all elements on their pages to work this way.
  The first style in the head section above ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way.
  The width you set is the width you get, without having to perform mental math and manage the complexity that comes from widths that come from multiple properties.
  Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:</p>

<div id="example1">This div has a full width of 300px, no matter padding or border!</div>
<br>
<div id="example2">This div also has a full width of 300px, no matter padding or border!</div>
